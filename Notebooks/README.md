# Environment Setup
This is a step by step guide to setting up our environment using Docker, Python3, Network X, and Jupyter Ipython Notebooks:

### Step 1: Configure Docker and Jupyter IPython Notebooks
1. Visit this website to learn how to setup the Environment: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/docker-data-science/
2. Visit this website to better understand Jupyter Notebooks: http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html
3. Once you have the docker running open up your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8888/tree#


### Step 2: Upload and open our IPython notebooks or create your own
1. Upload our IPython Notebooks from the Notebooks folder on GitHub into your Jupyter Files Page.
2. Upload the Data folder with all the data sets into the Jupyter files home page and make sure the folder is referenced correctly in the IPython Notebook.
2. Open up the Notebooks and run all the cells to reproduce our analysis.
3. If you are unfamiliar with NetworkX use their documentation here for help: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/
4. Feel free to do your own analysis by modifying ours or creating your own Notebooks from scratch.
